## Overview
This project showcases hand detection using the MediaPipe library. It's a simple yet powerful example of how you can leverage computer vision to identify and track hands in real-time using your webcam.

## Project Structure
- Library Imports: The project begins by importing the necessary libraries, including cv2 for computer vision and mediapipe for hand detection.
- Webcam Identification: It identifies your webcam, allowing you to use your local or external webcam.
- Image Processing: The code processes your webcam feed and converts the image from BGR to RGB, which is required for MediaPipe.
- Hand Detection with MediaPipe: It leverages the MediaPipe library to detect and track hand landmarks. The detected landmarks are then visualized on the screen.

## Usage
To run this project, make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can adjust the webcam source as needed by modifying the cv2.VideoCapture line. Simply run the script, and it will open a window with your webcam feed, detecting and drawing landmarks on your hands in real-time.

Feel free to modify and integrate this hand detection functionality into your own applications or projects.
